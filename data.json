When that life falls short of his expectations, he runs away from home to return to Sodeshima to find his childhood friend, Akari. But before they can rekindle their old feelings for each other, the clock strikes six and Kanae finds himself inexplicably thrust forward four days into the future. Worse, he learns that Akito, Akari’s older brother—and Kanae’s childhood hero—is dead.<br><br>Except death might not be the end for Akito. As Kanae tries to fill in the four-day gap of his memories, Akari explains: he’s about to relive those four days in reverse order in a phenomenon known as “Rollback.” Kanae himself explained it to her…in a past he hasn’t yet experienced. Armed with this new knowledge, Kanae is determined to leverage Rollback however he can to save Akito’s life—and Akari’s heart.",

But through the dedication of the queen’s successors, the kingdom has enjoyed great prosperity. Kriemhild, the daughter of the fifth queen, ascends to the throne with the same determination to protect the kingdom. Her elder sister Brunhild fell victim to the corruption of divine power, much like predecessors. Bearing that burden, Kriemhild steps into the throne room.

But 700 years before the Empire's cannon pierced the dragon's breast, there was another girl. Threatened by an evil dragon, the people of a small kingdom formed a pact with a Divine Dragon and flourished under its protection. Brunhild is born into the house of the Dragon Priestesses—the only ones in the land who can understand the dragon's words. Like her mother and her mother's mother before her, she serves the Divine Dragon, cleaning his temple, listening to his sacred words, and gratefully offering him tribute: seven people every month.",

A place of perfection, where man and beast live side by side in harmony… Eden’s protector, the silver dragon, regularly visits retribution upon those who would bring harm to paradise.

He teaches her that if she is to be welcomed into God’s kingdom after death, she must not harbor hatred in her heart. But when the dragon’s life is mercilessly snuffed out by human machinations, the girl must choose whether to heed his dying wish and stay the course of righteousness…or walk a path of vengeance.",
