A place of perfection, where man and beast live side by side in harmony… Eden’s protector, the silver dragon, regularly visits retribution upon those who would bring harm to paradise. But when the dragon discovers a human girl on the shores of Eden, he decides to raise her as his own. He teaches her that if she is to be welcomed into God’s kingdom after death, she must not harbor hatred in her heart. But when the dragon’s life is mercilessly snuffed out by human machinations, the girl must choose whether to heed his dying wish and stay the course of righteousness…or walk a path of vengeance.",

But 700 years before the Empire's cannon pierced the dragon's breast, there was another girl. Threatened by an evil dragon, the people of a small kingdom formed a pact with a Divine Dragon and flourished under its protection. Brunhild is born into the house of the Dragon Priestesses—the only ones in the land who can understand the dragon's words. Like her mother and her mother's mother before her, she serves the Divine Dragon, cleaning his temple, listening to his sacred words, and gratefully offering him tribute: seven people every month.",
